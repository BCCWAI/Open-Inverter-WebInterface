Pin Number,Function,Observations,Guessed Function
1,dc bus voltage monitoring,20v on the dc bus gives 130mV output
2,Temp sensor,11.8k to gnd at approx 15c
3,Temp sensor,55k to gnd at approx 15c
4,Temp sensor,55k to gnd at approx 15c
5,Temp sensor,55k to gnd at approx 15c
6,+12v Vcc
7,+5v supply required,Supply for dc bus discharge
8,DC bus discharge pin,Float to discharge dc bus. Ground to remove discharge
9,+5V Vcc
10,+12V Vcc
11,GND
12,+5V Vcc
13,UVLO,Measured +5v with power stage on own. Derived from +5V Vcc. Drops to 0.6v when loaded with a 1k resistor to gnd. This pin goes low if 12V Vcc drops to approx 8v,UVLO???
14,IGBT Driver Reset,"Active low. When low , shutsdown all drivers. 1K pullup to +5v Vcc"
15,Unknown,Measured +5v with power stage on own. Derived from +5V Vcc. Drops to 4.8v when loaded with a 1k resistor to gnd.,IGBT Fault line. Possibly a multiplex of Hi and Lo side and buffered??
16,Phase A High,"IGBT Drive Signal. 0V low , 5v high"
17,Phase A Low,"IGBT Drive Signal. 0V low , 5v high"
18,Unknown,Measured +5v with power stage on own. Derived from +5V Vcc. Drops to 4.8v when loaded with a 1k resistor to gnd.,IGBT Fault line. Possibly a multiplex of Hi and Lo side and buffered??
