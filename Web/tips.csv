Hardware,Snubbers caps use 1uF for every 100A on rails.
Hardware,Clean flux, it attracts moisture and causes shorts.
Hardware v1/2,You can use pin18 on main board for temperature indicator.<br><img src="pcb/Hardware v1.0/temp_indicator.png" />
Hardware v1/2,If encoder requires 5V leave out R2 and connect Pin 2 directly to 5V.
Hardware,The faster the switching (pwmfrq) the higher the losses in the inverter and the lower the losses in the motor.
Firmware,fweak applies only to sensor operation.
Firmware,Make ampmin as small as possible to get good economy.
Firmware,fslipmin=fslipmax (no slip) useful during debugging.
Hardware,Combine film caps (100uF) and elcaps (1500uF) to get optimal current damping.
Hardware v1/2,Signal from encoder is translated by BC547 transistor - 5V to encoder is OK.
Hardware v1/2,Measuring Pin3 from encoder 0.8V is normal, it is the Vbe of any bipolar transistor.
Hardware v1/2,Modifying encoder for high impedance low-pass filtered digital input.<br>Remove R1, R3 and T1 and bridge the base to the collector (bridge two pins of T1 that are NOT connected to the ground).<br><img src="pcb/Hardware v1.0/encoder_lowpass.png" />
Hardware v2,If getting error LORESAMP with resolver (LM386) remove R4, short R6 and remove C3.
Hardware,Which phase connects + charging line for boost charger? Use outside phases and do not connect to the middle phase.
Firmware,encflt may cause delays in the control loop. Setting it to 0 disables filtering entirely.
Hardware,Some STM32 pins are 5V tolerant and all others can take 5V with a simple 10k series resistor.
Hardware,CAN gain of 10 = 100mV resolution
Firmware,Firmware HEX file has the target address already in it.
Firmware,Current STM32F103 usage: 20% flash, 30% sram, 30% cpu at the highest PWM frequency.
Firmware,pwmpol is gate 'polarity' Active High = Off, Active Low = On (pulling the gates to ground)
Firmware,udcnom configure ONCE for your motor rating - no matter the input voltage. If you configure for 300V the inverter will change fweak and boost it, even if you run at 30V.
Firmware,The higher the dead time, the lower achievable AC output voltage.
Firmware,Voltage calibration: with no voltage connected set udcgain=1. Then read udc and set udcofs=udc. Then apply a known voltage and set udcgain=udc/u_known.
Hardware,PMSM motor works with ABZ encoder, ACIM will not work - use AB.
Firmware,fslipspnt and ampnom values are not stored and go back to their default state when the inverter is reset.
Combi-Board,Combi-Board remove R21 for better performance.
Hardware v3,Current boards with MLX91205 hall sensor do not populate R50 and R51.
Hardware,Never scope both low side and high side IGBTs at the same time unless you are using differential probes.
Hardware v3,If the encoder (AB quadrature) has a push-pull output you need to do nothing at all. Leave JP2.2 and JP2.4 unconnected and find power for the encoder somewhere else. If the encoder is open-collector you need to populate R17 and R18. ABZ and single channel it's a bit more changes check schematics.
Hardware v3,To find syncofs you set throtid=1, throtiq=0.05. Now find a syncofs where the motor won't move at all, even at full throttle. Careful, the motor can spin up uncontrolled! Disabling regen helps.
Hardware v3,WARN - HICUROFS1 - It means when at idle the voltage delivered by the current sensor is outside the window of 1.25-2.08V. A voltage divider for 5->3V3 in place? For V3 this means R50/51 populated with 4k7?
Hardware v3, IPM type motor needs some demagnetizing current for most torque per ampere. A rough tuning with a ratio -3/2 (e.g. throtiq=3, throtid=-2).
Hardware v3,The cruise function will oscillate when there is no load on the motor because of filtering. Try setting speedflt=0. When running a vehicle set speedflt=4.
Firmware,The symptom of the motor turning slowly is almost certainly caused by a missing or inverted encoder signal. Try to swap A and B channels.
Battery, Put fuse in the middle of the pack. If there is a short circuit, your battery is immediately split into half voltage.
Firmware,CAN parameters are internally scaled with 32. Say you set fslipmin to 1 then it will be "32" in memory, set to 1.5 it is "48" in memory.
Hardware v3,Leaf inverter should be operated at 8.8kHz.
Hardware v3,FOC code needs to use correct sensor on correct phase. 'pinswap' parameter in software able to swap the source, but swapping sensor wires physicaly is better.
Hardware v3,Encoder provides rotor speed. A resolver will give rotor speed and angular position. Permanent magnet motor requires a resolver.
Hardware v3,PB1 and PC9 must be grounded and PB5 must be floating. That will detect as "Prius" board.
