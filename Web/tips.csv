Snubbers caps use 1uF for every 100A on rails.
fweak applies only to sensor operation.
Clean flux, it attracts moisture and causes shorts.
You can use pin18 on main board for temperature indicator. <img src="img/temp_indicator.png" />
If encoder requires 5V leave out R2 and connect Pin 2 directly to 5V.
The faster the switching (pwmfrq) the higher the losses in the inverter and the lower the losses in the motor.
There are two types of encoders, transmissive (gap type) as TCST2103 and reflective. <img src="img/TCST2103.jpg" />
The larger the gap of encoder wheel the more problems will occur with ambient light. <a href="http://heliosoph.mit-links.info/make-your-own-rotary-encoder/">Info</a>
Make ampmin as small as possible to get good economy.
fslipmin=fslipmax (no slip) useful during debugging.
